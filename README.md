# OSSM_byEmma
Coding project for controlling the Open Source Sex Machine (OSSM) Emma has built.

Essentially the OSSM maps two rotary 10k potentiometers to control a) Stroke depth, b) Stroke speed.


Project goals:
* Set an initial oscillation point to have strokes go back and forth from there. (default is strokes go back from max point)
* Be able to change stroke speed on the fly.
* Be able to change oscillation point on the fly
